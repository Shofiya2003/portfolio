            I live in [Your City] and I'm on a mission to learn as many things as possible! I recently graduated{' '}
            <a href="#" className="highlight-link">Your University & Major</a> and previously worked at{' '}
            <a href="#" className="highlight-link">Company Name</a>, where I was building [Your Achievement].
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time, I'm obsessed with{' '}
            <span className="highlight-text">creating meaningful content</span>. I post content 
            on career, lifestyle, and college on Tiktok followers, views, LinkedIn followers, views, and Youtube followers. I also love sharing coding tutorials and 
            educational notes on Twitter.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also care deeply about building community. In college, I took a gap to found{' '}
            <a href="#" className="highlight-link">Project Name</a>, a [brief project description] and 
            scaled to [achievement metric]. I also regularly host events for [Organization Names].
